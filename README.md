## My process
- Created Sveltekit + Tailwind boilerplate with lots of optional packages I might experiment with
- Configured basics (favicon, etc.) that would be consistent for all FEM projects and made a template repository on github
- Initial commit, checked assets were functional, and imported fonts
- Designed & tested mobile component
- Added responsive classes for desktop component
- Deployed on Vercel

### Built with

- [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

### What I learned

Most of my learning involved making setup easier for future projects. I refined my Sveltekit + Tailwind boilerplate, and I learned how to make a template repo in github. I was having issues losing assets & styling deploying to Github Pages that I didn't have on Vercel. This is likely a static HTML issue with GH pages, and in the process of diagnosing it I learned much more about Svelte's file & component structuring. or now, it's on to the next project.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I'd like to do further research on this static HTML issue with GH pages.

I'm also noticing that unstyled content is appearing for a fraction of a second before loading properly. This is not simply a nit with the dev version as originally hoped, and will likely occur in future projects. High priority bug fix.

### Useful resources

- [Publishing on GH Pages from a build branch](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/sveltekit-github-pages-4fe2844773de) - Though I went with Vercel instead, this was helpful in learning to use Svelte's static adapter. Publishing /build to a new branch is a useful trick for the future.
